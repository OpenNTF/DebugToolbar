XPages API Inspector
==============================================================================================================
Simply insert the ccAPIInspector custom control to an XPage.

A combo box will automatically load all id's from when the page was loaded. 
Select the id of the component you want to inspect, to get the class (methods/properties), 
or write a custom expression (class name, or anything resulting in a Java object).

The expressions written into the field are run on the server, so handle with care!
